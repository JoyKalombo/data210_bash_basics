Here we are looking at some basic bash commands

Firstly we have ls (for list). \n
ls -a (this lists all files including the hidden ones) \n 
cd (this means "change directory") \n 
cd .. (this means go back a level) \n 
cd ../ .. (this means go back 2 levels) \n 
cd ../ ../ .. (this means go back 3 levels) \n 
cd / (change to root... all the way up... even further up than home) 
\n 

r (read)  w (write)  x(execute) \n 
ls -l (list normal files and info)
ls -la (list normal fies and info and also the hidden ones... so all 
files) \n 

Absolute path (route from root (c) to desired location... this is 
always the same, hence absolute) \n 
Relative path (root from current location to desired location.. the 
path depends on current location, hence relative) \n 

\n 

mkdir (make directory)
nano "text name" opens the file in a text editor \n 

cat "myfile" shows the content of that file \n 

cp (copy command). This takes two arguments; the file being copied 
and the name you want to assign to the copied file. \n 

mv (move file). This takes 2 arguments; the file to be moved and the 
location to which it will be moved \n 

rm (removes file) \n 
rm -rf (recursively removes file (so files and all files within the 
file)) \n 

pwd (print working directory) \n 

grep (searches for a specific thing within a named file) \n 

touch (this makes a file)
